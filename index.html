    Hello, my name is Brandon Neal. I am a 3D Designer working as a contractor for General Motors, where I work on infotainment systems using Unreal Engine.
    Previously I was a Digtal Printer and Retoucher for Esigns, where I worked on client artwork, as well as using Vutek printers to print their products.
    I also have a background as a GUI Artist through my work at Altair Engineering. Where I created icons and other art assets for their engineering software.
    I am currently learning web development through a Udemy course to become a front end web developer.
